Note: I've included just the first few cells to stay within response limits. The full notebook would contain additional cells covering feedback mechanisms, certification schemes, visualization examples, and all other sections from the article. Each section would include relevant code examples, markdown explanations, and proper error handling.

Let me know if you would like to see additional cells for any specific section of the notebook.
